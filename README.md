# Software Development Project
## Abstract
Problem Statement:
	
	At present, people interested in buying rare and valuable items need to attend auction places physically.
	This type of system is very manual and time consuming, and participation of general public is limited.
	The primary objective of our project on Online Auction System is to reduce the complexity of the physical system and introduce automation.
	In our online system which will be available across the India, users/auctioneers can buy or sell their valuable items from the comfort of their homes.

	Updated : 
	[In today's world,physical auctions are time-consuming and participation is limited 
	by geography,terrain, and economic situation, more so when we add the antiques or auctionable items to that list.
	Hence, we have come up with a better alternative that removes physicality and introduces automated governance, making this system 
	easily accessible to most people across India and in essence the world which allows them to auction valuable items comfortably]

Objective: 

	1. Provide a seamless payment gateway for quick and efficient fund transfer.
	2. Paperless Bidding System.
	3. Ensure Long-term relationship between our customers and partners
	4. Reliable Buyer/Seller validation
	5. Accurate product and pricing information
	6. Provide insurance on items under our jurisdiction

	Updated : 
	[1. Quick Funds Transfer
	 2. Automated Governance
	 3. Buyer/Seller Authentication
	 4. Systemic Product & Pricing Catalogue
	 5. Item Valuable & Insurance Policy
	 6. Privacy Protection]

Feasibility:

	1. Economic Feasibility:
		Our platform will ensure profitability for the business in all cases, even where an item is not bid upon.
		If an user wants to enlist their item on our platform, they will be required to pay a certain fixed amount or a certain percentage of their 
		item price evaluation, whichever is higher. This forward payment will ensure validity of the user, and provide us with a minimum revenue.
		Furthermore, upon successful selling of any item, a commission of certain percentage will be charged according to the highest bid(inclusive of the
		insurance). This will ensure a stable source of revenue.
	
	Addition :
	[Our platform requires a estimated time of 4 months with the capacity of serving atmost 25 customers at a time.
	To scale this platform to serve 1 million customers, a Business(BigQuery) Cloud Server API would be beneficial which cost around $3000/year.
	On top of that, we have a core team of 4 memebers, whose product development fee would range from x-y amount/month.
	Additionally, our product has been build on certain assumptions whose cost has not been covered here, but the
	Razor Payment Gateway API would cost an equivalent amount of $500/year, if not more.]

	Updated :
	[Our platform ensures profitability for the business after creation, even when the item is not bidded upon through,IVI fund
	 which is taken through our insurance policy that states that it is a cautionary fees that is not refundable and will be levied
	 upon the seller. We also make sure that the buyer pays a certain fixed amount or a certain percentage of the highest bid price
	 through the forward payment which will ensure us to authenticate the users-identity, and issue them with a transport-id that they
	 they can use to receive their bought item.]
	
	2. Legal Feasibility:
		During registration of any user, the user will need to agree to certain terms and conditions which include but are not limited to:
			1. Item will not inlude any piece of real estate.
			2. The user will need to provide their legal identity upon buying or selling of an item.
			3. Upon non-payment of a winning bid, the bidders reputation score will be impacted negatively.
	3. Design Feasibility:
		This project will be developed by a team of four within a provided time of 4 months, of which 40% percent will be spent on designing, planning and
		customer feedback. 20% of the time will be spent on the model/platform prototype development. The rest will be spent testing and product development.

Overview:
	Our platform will have an online homepage which show a catalogue of ongoing and pending auctions. The user can register/login from the same page.
	The user database will be fetched for authentication or will be updated upon successful registration. Upon successful authentication, the user can 
	bid on any ongoing auction, wishlist any pending auction, or put their own item on auction. Once the item is verified, the item will be hosted 
	on the platform for the users to bid upon. On any ongoing auction, users can bid the next higher bid as long as the auction will go on.
