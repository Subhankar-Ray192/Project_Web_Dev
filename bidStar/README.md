# Software Development Project
## Abstract
### Problem Statement:

	In today's world,physical auctions are time-consuming and participation is limited by geography,terrain, and economic situation, more so when we add the antiques or 		auctionable items to that list.Hence, we have come up with a better alternative that removes physicality and introduces automated governance, making this system easily 	accessible to most people across India and in essence the world which allows them to auction valuable items comfortably.


### Objective: 
``` 
1. Quick Funds Transfer
2. Automated Governance
3. Buyer/Seller Authentication
4. Systemic Product & Pricing Catalogue
5. Item Valuable & Insurance Policy
6. Privacy Protection
```

### Feasibility:
1. Economic Feasibility:

Our platform requires a estimated time of 4 months with the capacity of serving atmost 25 customers at a time.To scale this platform to serve 1 million customers, a Business(BigQuery) Cloud Server API would be beneficial which cost around $3000/year.On top of that, we have a core team of 4 memebers, whose product development fee would range from x-y amount/month.Additionally, our product has been build on certain assumptions whose cost has not been covered here, but the Razor Payment Gateway API would cost an equivalent amount of $500/year, if not more.

2. Legal Feasibility:

During registration of any user, the user will need to agree to certain terms and conditions which include but are not limited to:
   I. Item will not inlude any piece of real estate.
   II. The user will need to provide their legal identity upon buying or selling of an item.
   III. Upon non-payment of a winning bid, the bidders reputation score will be impacted negatively.

3. Design Feasibility:
	
This project will be developed by a team of four within a provided time of 4 months, of which 40% percent will be spent on designing, planning and customer feedback. 20% of the time will be spent on the model/platform prototype development. The rest will be spent testing and product development.

4. Market Feasibility:

Our platform ensures profitability for the business after creation, even when the item is not bidded upon through,IVI fund which is taken through our insurance policy that states that it is a cautionary fees that is not refundable and will be levied upon the seller. We also make sure that the buyer pays a certain fixed amount or a certain percentage of the highest bid price through the forward payment which will ensure us to authenticate the users-identity, and issue them with a transport-id that they they can use to receive their bought item.

### Overview:
	Our platform will have an online homepage which show a catalogue of ongoing and pending auctions. The user can register/login from the same page.The user database will be fetched for authentication or will be updated upon successful registration. Upon successful authentication, the user can bid on any ongoing auction, wishlist any pending auction, or put their own item on auction. Once the item is verified, the item will be hosted on the platform for the users to bid upon. On any ongoing auction, users can bid the next higher bid as long as the auction will go on.Our online '??'

### Assumption: (Human-Element,Percepts|Input Data Format| System-Bound Restriction)

	1. Human-Elements:
	2. System-Bound Restrictions:
	3. Input-Data-Restrictions:

### Planning: [Planning Time = (Total Project Time%)*Total Project Time] | 
          [Sum of Task Estimated + Buffer Time] | 
          [Buffer Time = Total Project Duration * Buffer Percentage]

	1. Design Analysis:
	2. Legal & Profitability Analysis:

### Platform: (System Requirement: Laptop,OS,Browser,Protocol,Cloud).

	1. OS-Supported: Windows 10
	2. Browser-Supported: Chrome

### Tools: MERN, MEAN, [HTML,CSS,JS], VCS(GitHub), Docs.

1. Source Control Management System(SCM) tools are used for keeping track of each team-members work and progress with re   spect to the project being developed. The prefered SCM-Tool we are using is GitHub for hosting our project details. 
2. The Client-Side Project will be a Webpage that will facilitate GUI controls for easier manuevring and better designing through the use of HTML,CSS,JavaScript languages as core building blocks.
3. The Server-Side Database will be used for information storage and will be implemented through Express.js, Node.js and MongoDB.
