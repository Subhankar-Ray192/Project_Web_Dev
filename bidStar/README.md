## Problem Statement:
	
In today's world,physical auctions are time-consuming and participation is limited by geography,terrain, and economic situation, more so when we add the antiques or 	auctionable items to that list. Hence, we have come up with a better alternative that removes physicality and introduces automated governance, making this system easily 	accessible to most people across India and in essence the world which allows them to auction valuable items comfortably.

## Objective: 

1. Quick Funds & Items Transfer
2. Automated Governance
3. Customer Authentication
4. Product Recommendation System
6. Customer Privacy Policy

## Economic Feasibility:

Our planning phase will take an estimate of two months, with the front-component being the first to be designed, tested and handed to the database administrators,architect and developer for schema generation and table generation. The final plan will be executed with the generation of a data-flow diagram which will lead to integration testing and product deployment.

Our platform is built using a pipeline approach that builds individual components before integrating them. Initial estimates show that each component requires a minimum of two weeks with another additional one week for integration testing. This gives us effectively a month for building the prototype and another two weeks to refactor it with rigorous testing.
	
## Legal Feasibility:
		
During registration of any user, the user will need to agree to certain terms and conditions which include but are not limited to:

	I. Items will not include any piece of real estate.
	II. The user will need to provide their legal identity upon buying or selling of an item.
	III. Upon non-payment of a winning bid, the bidders reputation score will be impacted negatively.


## Design Feasibility:
		
This project will be developed by a team of four separated into three orthogonal teams with one leading the project through foundational designs analysis based upon which the other two teams will simultaneously handle the back and front components. The project will go through rigorous tests before its feasibility can be fully ascertained. However, for the time-being the project looks partially feasible.

## Market Feasibility:

Our platform ensures profitability for the business after its creation, even when the item is not bidded upon through, Insurance and Protection Fund(IPF) which is part of this system’s insurance policy that, “it is a cautionary fee that is not refundable and will be levied upon the seller.”

 We also make sure that our customers pay a certain fixed amount or a certain percentage of the highest bid price (whichever is possible) through forward payment which will enable us to authenticate and verify the users-identity, and issue them with a transport-id that they can use to receive the auctioned item.


## Overview:[Incomplete]

Our platform will have an online homepage which shows a catalog of ongoing and pending auctions. The user can register/login from the same page.The user database will be fetched for authentication or will be updated upon successful registration. Upon successful authentication, the user can bid on any ongoing auction, wishlist any pending auction, or put their own item on auction. Once the item is verified, the item will be hosted on the platform for the users to bid upon. On any ongoing auction, users can bid the next higher bid as long as the auction will go on.Our online

## Platform: 

## Customer:

(System Requirement: Laptop,OS,Browser,Protocol,Cloud).

	1. OS-Supported: Windows 10
	2. Browser-Supported: Chrome

## Developer:

(System Requirement: Laptop,OS,Browser,Protocol,Cloud).

	1. OS-Supported: Windows 10
	2. Browser-Supported: Chrome

## Tools: 

Source Control Management System(SCM) tools are used for keeping track of each team-members work and progress with respect to the project being developed. The prefered SCM-Tool we are using is GitHub for hosting our project details. 

The Client-Side Project will be a Webpage that will facilitate GUI controls for easier maneuvering and better designing through the use of HTML,CSS,JavaScript languages as core building blocks.

The Server-Side Database will be used for information storage and will be    implemented through Express.js, Node.js and MongoDB.
